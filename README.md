Our closed loop controller utilizes position feedback to command our test kit motors
to follow a step response and rotate a flywheel 1 rotation. Our controller utilizes proportional control of the form
*K<sub>P</sub>*(*&theta<sub>1</sub>* - *&theta<sub>2</sub>*). We implemented a logical statement that disables the
motor once it has completed one full rotation. The figures below display our progression
of tuning our proportional gain, *K<sub>P</sub>*, to improve the step response.

Figure 1. Step response with input of 1 revolution; *K<sub>P</sub>* = XX.XX. The steady state 
error is XX.XX and the response time to steady state is approximately XX.XX seconds.
